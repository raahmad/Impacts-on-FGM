#best NBA players like Lebron, Giannis, and Harden near the top

#Question 1
#Is there a significant correlation between the amount of games played, 
#assists, and rebounds per game by each player and the field goals made per game that they have?

#Get correlation value for games played and field goals made
cor(merged_data$gp, merged_data$FGM)

nonamerican<-merged_data[merged_data$american=="Non-American","FGM"]

#the null hypothesis that the average FGM for 
#Americans and Non-Americans are equal

#not go to American colleges tend to have higher
#field goals made per game?

# p-value = 0.5312283

# The p-value > 0.05, so we fail reject the null hypothesis. There is no
# significant difference on field goals made per game between players that
# went to American colleges and players that did not go to American colleges.
