# Impacts on Field Goals Made Per Game



### Intro

Every NBA front office has a great interest in trying to get the best players they can possibly get in order to win more games and ultimately the NBA Finals. A great indicator for a great player is measured by the number of field goals made per game by a player throughout a full season. The higher the number of field goals made by a player, the better the player is perceived to be. Examining various basketball statistics, player measurements, and player background information can give front offices information on which variables relate to and impact field goals made per game the most. As a result, executives can use that information to make transactions to increase the performance of their team.

In this project, we utilized data on basketball statistics, measurements, and background information of players from the 2019-20 season and examined the role that various statistics, measurements, and background information have on a player's field goals made per game. 


### Data

This project uses two primary sources of data: Kaggle data on NBA players from the 1996-97 season through the 2020-21 season, and Basketball-Reference data for NBA players in the 2019-20 season.
